# FlaskBlog
This is a learning project I built following a tutorial.

The is built with Python 3.6 using the Flask micro framework (a number of components) and SQLAlchemy along with a few other handy packages.

There's nothing super interesting going on yet, I plan to do some customization but I also plan to make a full-fledge web application based off what I've learned from this tutorial project.
